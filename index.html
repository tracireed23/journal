            <h2>First week of Web Foundations</h2>
            <h3>What did I get myself into?</h3>
            <body>Wow, I haven't written in a journal in forever! This should be fun! So, my first week of classes is complete. So far it seems to be going pretty quick, that can be taken both as good and bad. HTML is easy to get, and CSS, what I am most excited about, has me so confused. I don't understand what all the measurements for the px and %'s are and how I determine what I need. I didn't realize how time consuming this is. Just doing this journal project I have my HTML&amp;CSS book open, w3schools open, been googling things like crazy... And yet still having trouble figuring it all out. Being a single mom, who works full time, my schedule is pretty busy. Therefore when I actually have a chunck of time to do my homework, I spend a majority of the time frustrated because I can't figure it out. I have faith that I will get it, but dang it! I wish I had an CSS for Dummies book! But I know we will be going over more on all this as we progress in this class, so hopefully I will work through this block. </body>

            <h2>Half way through Prime</h2>
            <h3>Starting first group project.</h3>
            <body>Can't believe how quick this class is going by. 12 weeks sounds like a long time before you start it but once you start it seems to go pretty quick. So, Monday we got assigned our first group project. I am paired up with Blake, and I'm pretty sure we will have someone who wasn't in class on Monday will be added to our group today in class. We decided to name our group Team Tattoo, or Tatt for short. I am extremely excited to start this project, and hopefully work on some of the blocks that I have been having with CSS. I can't wait to see how it turns out!</body>
