            <h2>First week of Web Foundations</h2>
              <h3>What did I get myself into?</h3>
                <body>Wow, I haven't written in a journal in forever! This should be fun! So, my first week of classes is complete. So far it seems to be going pretty quick, that can be taken both as good and bad. HTML is easy to get, and CSS, what I am most excited about, has me so confused. I don't understand what all the measurements for the px and %'s are and how I determine what I need. I didn't realize how time consuming this is. Just doing this journal project I have my HTML&amp;CSS book open, w3schools open, been googling things like crazy... And yet still having trouble figuring it all out. Being a single mom, who works full time, my schedule is pretty busy. Therefore when I actually have a chunck of time to do my homework, I spend a majority of the time frustrated because I can't figure it out. I have faith that I will get it, but dang it! I wish I had an CSS for Dummies book! But I know we will be going over more on all this as we progress in this class, so hopefully I will work through this block. </body>

            <h2>Halfway through Prime</h2>
              <h3>Starting first group project.</h3>
                <body>Can't believe how quick this class is going by. 12 weeks sounds like a long time before you start it but once you start it seems to go pretty quick. So, Monday we got assigned our first group project. I am paired up with Blake Johnson, and I'm pretty sure we will have someone who wasn't in class on Monday will be added to our group today in class. We decided to name our group Teamtatt. I am extremely excited to start this project, and hopefully work on some of the blocks that I have been having with CSS. I can't wait to see how it turns out!</body>

            <h2>Teamtatt</h2>
              <h3>Final touches</h3>
                <body>So, tomorrow is our last day of Primer... Time flies when you're having fun I guess. Well, like I predicted we adopted (well that's what I like to call it) someone into our group. Joe Lara, but since the day we adopted him we have only heard from him once when he texted us back that he couldn't make it to our group meeting on sunday, so we agreed to just meet at 4 before class on Monday... Well long story short I'm pretty sure Joe isn't part of our group, well he is part of the group, he just didn't do anything. Therefore, Blake and I whipped up a pretty decent website for it being our first team project. We got together today at his apartments and used their free wifi to work on our finishing touches... BUT, yes there is a but, we are having problems with merging our work. Everytime we try to push and pull things we lose some of our work and have to redo it. So we have the finished product that we like on my local, and we are scared to commit and push it up to the master repo, because we don't want to mess up what we spent the last few days fixing. So, hopefully this block will be figured out before we have to present our Chiropractic Website to the class. </body>

            <h2>So far in Pro</h2>
              <h3>Learning Javascript</h3>
                <body>I can't believe that we are already done with primer and a week into pro! I feel like it hasn't been that long and that I have learned so much so far. I am really getting the hang of things. I have spent A LOT of time this last week catching up on treehouse, because I was falling pretty far behind in that. Finding time to focus on working treehouse with my three year old isn't easy. Therefore, I am beginning to lose a lot of my quality beauty sleep! But I am starting to understand why what I am doing works. I am still not all the way caught up. I am going to work on the homework today before lab and during lab today. I am still trying to understand Javascript. I like that it brings everythingto life! The presentation of the website so far is my favorite. The only blocks I am coming across is just finding time outside of class to work on things. But I am figuring it out! I can't wait to start building our next project. I am ready to start practicing applying what I have learned!

            <h2>Figuring out JavaScript</h2>
             <h3>Now I have a headache</h3>
                <body>So, let me tell you about JavaScript. It's confusing... It isnt' clicking with me yet. I mean I know how to do some stuff with it... But my dad told me to try not to force myself and get too frustrated, because I have a habit of doing that. I am currently watching some more JavaScript on Treehouse, and I just saw Nathan's slack message about the new updates to w3schools so I might go checkout some of their tutorials too. I am also learning a little bit about how to get started with Bootstrap. I decided for my final project I am going to make myself a portfolio. My passion is Art. Whether it is drawing, painting, tattooing, making crafts/diy projects, sewing and costume designs. So I decided I am going to start a basic portfolio for my work with Bootstrap and then be able to add to it and keep it up to date for future use. I am actually pretty excited about it! Can't wait to dive in, gonna watch a few more videos on Bootstrap before I do though. Hopefully this will help me understand JavaScript better. As an artist I am a strong believer in practice makes perfect.

            <h2>New and improved!</h2>
              <h3>Rebuilding my portfolio</h3>
                <body>So for this next project we were given a choice of a few different things. I decided that instead of rebuilding our first chiropractic website aka teamtatt, I decided to rebuild our very first coding project which was a portfolio. My passion is art and I thought it would be nice to have an online portfolio for people to look at. I am using bootstrap to rebuild it. I am pretty excited about it! It is coming together quite nicely for me working by myself with the crazy schedule that I have had lately, being a single mom, working 40+ hours a week AND going to school was a lot more of a load than I thought it was going to be. But I am doing it! I am determined to finish this out, and start a new career. </body>

            <h2>First week of AFE!</h2>
              <h3>Not off to a great start...</h3>
                <body>I am so excited about taking this class. I had to work extra hours at work and do extra odds and ends jobs to pay for this class. I love learning new things and I am really starting to like coding. First week of class though... not starting out the way I wanted to. Woke up Wednesday with a 100.2 fever and a HORRIBLE head cold. It's now 5 days later and I still feel like crap. Haven't had time to do anything. I finally caught up on stuff around my house, and it is Mother's day! Not how I pictured my mother's day going... I am going to try to get off work early tomorrow to meet up with Jamie, because she is my partner on this first project, which I feel horrible because she has done most of it with me being sick. I wish I had more time to do class work but trying to get better AND still take care of my daughter because I am a single mom is hard enough as it is... I am hoping *cross my fingers* I start to feel better tomorrow and/or the next few days! I can't afford to miss anymore class, especially since I am paying for this class out of pocket. I just wanted to update my journal because I need to at least do something! <br><br> 
                MY GOALS FOR THIS CLASS:<br> My main goal for this class is to absorb as much as I can. I plan on continueing my education in coding whether here at PCS or on treehouse or wherever, after this class to help work towards moving up to a developer at my work. I am a single mom with one full time job and one part time job AND going to school. So my time is limited and I don't want to set goals for myself that I won't be able to reach. I WANT to be able to possibly start doing small web builds at work by the time I am done with this class. I am going to try my hardest to get to that point. Hoping to be able to dive in and focus once I am no longer sick...
