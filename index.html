            <h2>First week of Web Foundations</h2>
            <h3>What did I get myself into?</h3>
            <body>Wow, I haven't written in a journal in forever! This should be fun! So, my first week of classes is complete. So far it seems to be going pretty quick, that can be taken both as good and bad. HTML is easy to get, and CSS, what I am most excited about, has me so confused. I don't understand what all the measurements for the px and %'s are and how I determine what I need. I didn't realize how time consuming this is. Just doing this journal project I have my HTML&amp;CSS book open, w3schools open, been googling things like crazy... And yet still having trouble figuring it all out. Being a single mom, who works full time, my schedule is pretty busy. Therefore when I actually have a chunck of time to do my homework, I spend a majority of the time frustrated because I can't figure it out. I have faith that I will get it, but dang it! I wish I had an CSS for Dummies book! But I know we will be going over more on all this as we progress in this class, so hopefully I will work through this block. </body>

            <h2>Halfway through Prime</h2>
            <h3>Starting first group project.</h3>
            <body>Can't believe how quick this class is going by. 12 weeks sounds like a long time before you start it but once you start it seems to go pretty quick. So, Monday we got assigned our first group project. I am paired up with Blake Johnson, and I'm pretty sure we will have someone who wasn't in class on Monday will be added to our group today in class. We decided to name our group Teamtatt. I am extremely excited to start this project, and hopefully work on some of the blocks that I have been having with CSS. I can't wait to see how it turns out!</body>

            <h2>Teamtatt</h2>
            <h3>Final touches</h3>
            <body>So, tomorrow is our last day of Primer... Time flies when you're having fun I guess. Well, like I predicted we adopted (well that's what I like to call it) someone into our group. Joe Lara, but since the day we adopted him we have only heard from him once when he texted us back that he couldn't make it to our group meeting on sunday, so we agreed to just meet at 4 before class on Monday... Well long story short I'm pretty sure Joe isn't part of our group, well he is part of the group, he just didn't do anything. Therefore, Blake and I whipped up a pretty decent website for it being our first team project. We got together today at his apartments and used their free wifi to work on our finishing touches... BUT, yes there is a but, we are having problems with merging our work. Everytime we try to push and pull things we lose some of our work and have to redo it. So we have the finished product that we like on my local, and we are scared to commit and push it up to the master repo, because we don't want to mess up what we spent the last few days fixing. So, hopefully this block will be figured out before we have to present our Chiropractic Website to the class. </body>
